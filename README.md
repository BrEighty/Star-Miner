This is my first truy at making a multiplatform app for Android and IOS. The app that I have made is a simple clicker game with the ability to upgrade the power of your click as you progress
I had some trouble when it came to making this multiplatform with Kotlin completely. I first made the app as it is in android and tried to convert it to IOS from there. I tried multiple ways through KMM and Flutter but I couldn't get either to work so I ended up just barrowing a macbook and trying to recreate it in xcode. That is what I spent the majority of the weekend on but I got stuck at the end when it came to getting the buttons to work. The code looks right, I think, but it doesn't seem to want to go through and the software won't let me view the debug screen so I don't know how to check where its going wrong.
